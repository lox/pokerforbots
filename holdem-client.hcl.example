# Holdem Client Configuration Example
# Copy this file to holdem-client.hcl and customize for your setup

server {
  url                = "http://localhost:8080"
  connect_timeout    = 10  # seconds
  request_timeout    = 30  # seconds
  reconnect_attempts = 3   # number of reconnection attempts
  reconnect_delay    = 5   # seconds between reconnection attempts
}

player {
  name             = "YourPlayerName"  # REQUIRED: Your display name at the table
  default_buy_in   = 200               # Default buy-in amount
  auto_rebuy       = false             # Automatically rebuy when chips are low
  rebuy_threshold  = 50                # Rebuy when chips fall below this amount
}

ui {
  log_level        = "info"    # debug, info, warn, error
  log_file         = "holdem-client.log"
  show_hole_cards  = true      # Show your hole cards in the UI
  show_bot_thinking = false    # Show AI reasoning (can be noisy)
  auto_scroll_log  = true      # Automatically scroll game log
  confirm_actions  = false     # Require confirmation for fold/call/raise
  theme            = "default" # default, dark, light
}

# Network Configuration Notes:
# - URL should match your server's address and port
# - For remote servers, use "http://server-ip:port" or "https://domain:port"
# - Increase timeouts if you have a slow or unreliable connection
# - Auto-rebuy is useful for long sessions but requires careful bankroll management

# UI Configuration Notes:
# - Set log_level to "debug" for troubleshooting connection issues
# - show_bot_thinking can help understand AI decisions but creates verbose output
# - confirm_actions adds safety but slows down play
